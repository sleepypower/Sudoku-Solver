# Sudoku-Solver
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG7Gm8i1McE
#### Description:
#### Solves given sudoku with a backtracking algorithm.
#### At the moment, there are 3 files. main.py, sudoku_class.py, and finally graphics.py
#### main.py contains the abstractions of the sudoku_class and just receives the final board.
#### After some calculations, it determines whether the sudoku can be solved or not. If it can,
#### solves it. 
#### sudoku_class.py contains the big chunk of code, it uses a backtracking algorithm to find all
#### the possible combinations of sudokus (given the initial board) and returns a valid solution.
#### Also checks if the initial board is valid (there is no point to find a solution to something 
#### that is wrong).
#### Finally, the graphics.py has not been implemented just yet.
#### Also I made a research on other types of algorithms that can solve sudokus, explaining why I
#### ended up taking cs50 Artificial Intelligence
